# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
    Learning how to refactoring the existing functionality to make it more efficient and readable. 
    
## Purpose of the Analysis
    Learning how to refactoring the exising program can be a chanllenge and also a key to the develpers time to time when working with a real evironment.  As a developer, we should learn how to make programs cleaner and efficient to make better program, to provide a better service. Also we learned what tools to utilize the measurement so we can provide the proof of the better performance.
    
## Result
    Through out the class excercise we added code as it was needed at the time.  With this project we were re-visting the code we wrote earlier found the way to make it cleaner by adding comments and steps and consolidating the existing functinalities made the faster run when we measured the processing time.

## Summary
    The refactoring can generates a good revenue savings for the entrepreneur.  Ultimately the refactoring can provide more readable code to developers and more efficient programs to the user which cany save the development time and an equipment leverage, such as cost of memories, when it comes to running a larger volume of data in a real world application.

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?    
- It takes time to refactor.
- Risk involved - Better to refactor a small amount at a time, otherwise it may cause side effect on other project utilizes it. 
- Better done earlier than late - It may not be rewarded right away, but it surely rewards on a long run.
- It is necessary step if the project is continually used and maintained.
- Individual - It produces a good habit of coding/revising/rewriting if necessary.        
   
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?   
- We spent a good amount of time refactoring - coding, debugging, testing.
- It wasn't too complicated to refactor, since it was small projects. 
- It saved the elapsed time and saw how it can help the big projects.
- Writing a comment line be line helped understanding how it can be done in a big projects and help other collegues to understand it.
- Over all, it was a good practice
